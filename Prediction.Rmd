#Data read and cleaning
Raw training data have feilds with values equal to "", "NA" and  "#DIV/0!". Let us fix the issue by converting those values to NA while do data loading. 100 columns have more than 90% of NAs. We will exclude such columns from building the model. We also detected  and filtered out variables that are near zero variance predictiors. Finnaly, we removed variables(user_name, timestamps, etc) which do not have predictive power.

```{r Data Loading, cache=TRUE}
suppressMessages(library(caret))
training_raw<-read.table("pml-training.csv",sep=",",header=TRUE,na.strings =c("","NA","#DIV/0!") )
testing_raw<-read.table("pml-testing.csv",sep=",",header=TRUE,na.strings =c("","NA","#DIV/0!"))

DataClean<-function(df){
        #compute NAs percent for each column and select clulums with NAs<90%
        mask<-sapply(df,function(x) {ifelse(sum(is.na(x))/ length(x)>0.9,FALSE,TRUE)})
        training<-df[,mask]

        nzv <- nearZeroVar(training,saveMetrics = TRUE)
        training<-training[,!nzv$nzv]
        #remove first 6 attributes since they do not have predictive power
        training<-training[,-c(1:5)]
}
training<-DataClean(training_raw)
testing<-DataClean(testing_raw)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
